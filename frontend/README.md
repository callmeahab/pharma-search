# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/e4a85829-b929-42e6-8d58-ec74d89f7d6b

## API Integration

This frontend integrates with a backend API for real product search functionality.

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory:

```bash
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Backend Requirements

Make sure the backend API is running on `http://localhost:8000` before starting the frontend. The application will fall back to sample data if the API is not available.

### Search Functionality

- **Search Bar Dropdown**: Shows real product groups from API with pricing information
- **Without search terms**: Shows sample products with category filtering
- **With search terms**: Uses real backend API to search pharmaceutical products and displays them as individual product cards
- **API unavailable**: Automatically falls back to sample data filtering

### New Features

- **Smart Search Dropdown**: Displays actual product groups from the backend API with pricing
- **Product Cards**: Search results are displayed as individual product cards instead of grouped view
- **Real-time Search**: API calls with debouncing for optimal performance
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- **Title Humanization**: Automatically converts lowercase API titles to proper title case with pharmaceutical-specific formatting
  - Example: "vitamin d3 2000 iu" â†’ "Vitamin D3 2000 IU"
  - Handles special cases for pharmaceutical abbreviations (MG, MCG, IU, etc.)
- **Currency Formatting**: All prices displayed in Serbian Dinar (RSD) with proper localization
  - Consistent formatting across all components using `formatPrice()` utility
  - Serbian locale number formatting for better regional experience
