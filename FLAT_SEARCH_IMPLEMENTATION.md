# Flat Product Search Implementation

## Overview

This implementation removes product grouping and displays search results as a flat list of individual products, sorted by relevance and then by price. The search now utilizes vector search enhancers stored in the Product table to provide more accurate results.

## Backend Changes (`go-backend/main.go`)

### 1. New Function: `convertHitsToFlatProducts`
- Replaces `convertHitsToGroups` function
- Returns individual products instead of grouped results
- Enriches Meilisearch data with additional database fields:
  - `dosage_text` - Human-readable dosage information
  - `volume_text` - Package size/volume information
  - `form` - Product form (tablets, syrup, etc.)
  - `category` - Product category
  - `quality_score` - Product quality rating
  - `dosage_value` & `dosage_unit` - Structured dosage data
  - `photos` - Product images for enhanced visual display

### 2. Smart Filtering Function: `applySmartFiltering`
- Detects query intent and applies intelligent filtering:
  - **Dosage Intent**: Recognizes patterns like "vitamin d 1000", "magnesium 500mg"
  - **Package Size Intent**: Detects patterns like "30 kapsula", "60 tableta"
  - **Form Intent**: Identifies product forms like "sirup", "kapsule", "krem"
- Boosts relevant products by reordering results

### 3. Updated Search Functions
- `Search()`: Returns flat products list with smart filtering
- `SearchGroups()`: Modified for consistency (returns flat products)
- `PriceComparison()`: Enhanced for better price sorting

### 4. Helper Functions
- `containsNumberFromQuery()`: Matches numbers from query with product text
- `extractNumbers()`: Extracts numeric values from text
- `isNumeric()`: Validates numeric strings

## Frontend Changes

### 1. New Component: `FlatSearchResults.tsx`
- Dedicated component for displaying flat product results
- Enhanced product cards showing:
  - **Product images** with fallback placeholder support
  - **Clickable product titles** that trigger search for similar products
  - **Real-time price comparison** across all loaded products
  - **Smart price indicators** (cheapest, percentage above minimum, price ranges)
  - Vendor, brand, and form badges
  - Dosage and package information
  - Quality scores
  - Direct purchase buttons
  - Smooth hover animations and visual effects

### 2. Updated API Interface (`lib/api.ts`)
- Extended `Product` interface with new fields:
  - `dosage_text`, `volume_text`, `form`, `category`
  - `quality_score`, `dosage_value`, `dosage_unit`, `photos`
- Modified `SearchResult` interface to support both flat and grouped structures
- Added backward compatibility for existing grouped results

### 3. Updated Main Page (`app/page.tsx`)
- Intelligent detection of flat vs grouped results
- Uses `FlatSearchResults` component for new flat structure
- Maintains compatibility with legacy grouped results
- Enhanced pagination handling for both structures

### 4. Updated Search Bar (`components/SearchBar.tsx`)
- Improved product selection handling
- Better brand name display in autocomplete

## Smart Filtering Features

### Dosage Detection
- Recognizes: `mg`, `mcg`, `Î¼g`, `iu`, `ie`
- Example: "vitamin d 1000" prioritizes products with 1000 IU vitamin D

### Package Size Detection
- Recognizes: `kapsula`, `tableta`, `kom`, `x`
- Example: "30 kapsula" prioritizes products with 30 capsules

### Form Detection
- Recognizes: `sirup`, `kapsule`, `krem`, `gel`, `mast`, `sprej`, `kapi`, `prah`
- Example: "vitamin c sirup" prioritizes syrup formulations

## Price Comparison Features

### Real-Time Price Analysis
- **Product Grouping**: Automatically groups similar products by normalized names
- **Smart Normalization**: Removes dosage amounts and package sizes to group variants
- **Price Statistics**: Calculates min, max, and average prices for each product group

### Visual Price Indicators
- **Best Price Badge**: Green "Najbolja cena" badge for lowest-priced products
- **Price Difference**: Shows percentage above minimum price for expensive variants
- **Price Statistics**: Displays min/avg/max prices for product groups with multiple vendors
- **Warning Badges**: Orange badges for products significantly above average price (>20%)

### Interactive Features
- **Clickable Titles**: Product names are clickable and trigger searches for similar products
- **Smart Search**: Clicking a title searches for the product without dosage/package specifics
- **URL Updates**: Search queries update the browser URL for bookmarking and sharing

## Sorting Strategy

1. **Primary**: Meilisearch relevance score (vector search + text matching)
2. **Secondary**: Price (ascending)
3. **Smart Boosting**: Query intent-based reordering

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Direct access to individual products without grouping navigation
2. **Enhanced Search Accuracy**: Vector search enhancers provide semantic matching
3. **Smart Filtering**: Automatic detection of user intent for dosage, package size, and form
4. **Price Transparency**: All products visible with clear pricing
5. **Vendor Diversity**: Multiple vendors for similar products are clearly displayed
6. **Enhanced Product Information**: Rich metadata display (dosage, form, quality scores)
7. **Visual Product Discovery**: High-quality product images with intelligent fallbacks
8. **Improved Engagement**: Smooth animations and modern card-based interface
9. **Interactive Product Titles**: Click any product title to search for similar products
10. **Real-Time Price Comparison**: Automatic price analysis across all loaded products
11. **Smart Purchase Decisions**: Clear indicators for best deals and price differences

## Backward Compatibility

- The implementation maintains compatibility with existing grouped search results
- Frontend components automatically detect and handle both flat and grouped structures
- Legacy search endpoints continue to work as expected

## Database Utilization

The implementation leverages existing database fields that were previously used only for grouping:
- `dosageText`, `volumeText` - Enhanced product descriptions
- `form`, `category` - Product classification
- `qualityScore` - Product rating system
- Vector search enhancers stored in the Product table

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Filtering**: Add UI controls for dosage, form, and package size filtering
2. **Price Alerts**: Implement price tracking and alerts
3. **Vendor Ratings**: Display vendor reliability scores
4. **Personalization**: User preference-based result ordering
5. **Enhanced Analytics**: Track query intent effectiveness
